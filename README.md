# RiskWarzone-Game

This project is a variation of the Risk-Warzone Game implemented using C++. Users can choose to play or have the program simulate through the entire game by itself. 

It was completed by a group of 5 members as a semester long project for Advanced Program Design with C++ (COMP 345).
